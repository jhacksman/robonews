# RoboNews

A comprehensive repository of robotics news summaries, gathered and organized by Devin. This repository serves as a centralized resource for staying updated on the latest developments in the robotics industry.

## Purpose

RoboNews aims to provide well-organized, detailed summaries of robotics news based on various query types. Whether you're interested in the latest monthly updates, specific companies, geographic regions, or particular technologies, RoboNews offers structured reports with links and images to keep you informed.

## Folder Structure and Naming Conventions

The repository is organized using the following folder naming conventions:

1. **Time-based queries**: `YYYY-MM_robotics_news`
   - Example: `2025-03_robotics_news` for March 2025 news
   - Example: `2025-Q1_robotics_news` for Q1 2025 news

2. **Company-specific queries**: `company_COMPANYNAME`
   - Example: `company_boston_dynamics` for Boston Dynamics news

3. **Geographic queries**: `geo_REGION`
   - Example: `geo_portland_oregon` for robotics news from Portland, Oregon
   - Example: `geo_china` for robotics news from China

4. **Technology-specific queries**: `tech_TECHNOLOGY`
   - Example: `tech_humanoid_robots` for news about humanoid robots
   - Example: `tech_open_source_robotics` for open-source robotics news

5. **Application-specific queries**: `app_INDUSTRY`
   - Example: `app_healthcare` for healthcare robotics
   - Example: `app_manufacturing` for manufacturing robotics

## Report Format

Each folder contains:
- A markdown report (`report.md`) with detailed information, links, and embedded images
- An `images` directory containing all visual resources
- A `resources.zip` file with all resources for easy download

## Usage

To request a new report, specify the type of query and the scope. For example:
- "Provide the latest monthly robotics news (March 2025)"
- "Summarize news about Chinese humanoid robots from the last year"
- "Report on open-source software used by Mobile ALOHA from Stanford"
- "Update on robotics groups in Portland, Oregon"

The report will be organized in the appropriate folder based on the query type.
